# 3Dmapping-algorithm
This code shows an algorithm for importing and mapping 2D images to 3D plots. Mapping algorithm: maps 2D binary image to 3D form by transforming relative pixel color to depth. 
##First Image (Conventional Code) is generated from the attached code.
##Second Image (Modern Code) is generated for a more recent code that uses the same algorithm but cuts the main algorithm code to 5 lines
and allows for the automation of generating N slices on the X-dimension without any additional code development.
